## PDT or DC Outputs?

**Question:** Dataframe outputs from Data Converge (DC) and Precomputed Data Tables (PDT) are good candidates for prototyping Frictionless migration. Which one is better?

**TL;DR**: DC outputs

* Data Converge outputs
    * Finite number of experimental data types:
        * FACS
        * RNAseq
        * Plate reader
        * CFU
    * Reactor calculates summaries of the input tabular data
        * Number of unique values per column/row
        * MD5 hash
    * Schemas for inputs and outputs are implicitly defined in source code
        * But they are stable and consistent
* Precomputed Data Tables
    * Implicitly defined schemas in source code
    * The code for each analysis (data type) has a separate author
    * Some analyses still under active development
        * Bree Cummins on Wasserstein/circuit analysis
